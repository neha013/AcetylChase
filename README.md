# AcetylChase


**Project Overview:**
Bioinformatics-driven Drug Discovery for Alzheimer's Disease Targeting Acetylcholinesterase.

**Dataset:**

The [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) Database is a curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties, integrating chemical, bioactivity, and genomic data. With over 2 million compounds, it compiles information from more than 88,000 documents, 1.6 million assays, and encompasses 15,000 targets, 2,000 cells, and 45,000 indications. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers, aiding in the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs by providing comprehensive bioactivity data and facilitating the exploration of chemical structures and their biological activities.
